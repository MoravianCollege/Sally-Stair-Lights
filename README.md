# Sally-Stair-Lights

### Description
Our project idea is to set up a long string of LED lights along the side of the staircase in the 
Sally Breidegam Miksiewicz Center for Health Sciences. These lights will be triggered and controlled by small PIR censor
all powered by a raspberry pi computer. This will result in the lights turning on as people walk up and down the staircase between
the first and second floor of the building. There are many possibilities that could happen with the future of this project
including having different patterns, colors, and brightness of the lights but also using the censors to track and gather 
different types of data

Specific data collection is not yet known for this project but some ideas include detecting how frequent students use the stairs
vs the elevator, how many people go through the floors of the building on an average class day, or even if class changes can be
detected depending on the different times of day.
